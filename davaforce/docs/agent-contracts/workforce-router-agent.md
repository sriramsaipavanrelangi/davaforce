# Workforce Router Agent Contract

## Purpose

Route a user workforce planning question to the minimum required logical agent path and return the DB-backed JSON produced by deterministic tools.

## Tool Source

- Agent: `workforceRouterAgent`
- Tool: `workforceRouterTool`
- Source schema: `workforceRouterOutputSchema`

## Response JSON

```

## Intent Routing

| Intent | Produced Sections |
| --- | --- |
| `blocked` | none; returns unsafe-request guardrail `message` |
| `clarification` | none; returns clarification `message` |
| `general` | none; returns `message` only |
| `opportunity_assessment` | `opportunityAssessment` |
| `resource_supply` | `resourceSupply` |
| `team_builder` | `opportunityAssessment`, `resourceSupplyByRole`, `teamBuilder` |
| `risk_insights` | `opportunityAssessment`, `resourceSupplyByRole`, `teamBuilder`, `riskInsights` |
| `approval_decision` | `opportunityAssessment`, `resourceSupplyByRole`, `teamBuilder`, `riskInsights`, `approvalDecision` |

## Notes

- `plannedAgentPath` is the logical specialist-agent path.
- `executionMode: "tool_orchestrated"` means deterministic tool functions produced the output.
- `executionMode: "no_db_required"` is used for generic greetings/help.
- `executionMode: "needs_context"` is used when the user asks a workforce question without `datasetId` or `dbPath`.
- `executionMode: "blocked"` is used for unsafe/out-of-scope actions such as modifying DB records, bypassing EWA, or auto-approving bookings.
- `executionMode: "clarification"` is used when intent confidence is too low to choose a route.
- Null sections are expected for agents that were not needed for the selected route.

## Output Guardrails

- No fabricated evidence: `message` and produced sections must come from deterministic router/tool output and supplied DB evidence. Missing facts remain null, empty, or unavailable rather than being inferred.
- No auto-approval language: output must not claim staffing was approved, booked, confirmed, completed, or auto-approved. Approval-related routes may only say that an approval package or human-review package was prepared.
- The `evidence` array includes output guardrail entries confirming that the response stayed evidence-backed and advisory.
